Todo:
- write work summary and metadata

2024-06-10:
- finish process for 15-17, lots of autoimage issues
- deleted image absent runs SC011416A
- had to reprocess15-17
- started 18, manual delete an _autoiamge file and img abs run
- 2019 had lots of edited files, skipped those with list comp in filemove
    - also manually deleted some csv; lots of duplicate warnings think it's nested folder mess
    - because these files were more tampered, there's some whole sampling which are ruined for example CE_080619a was missing .tif files so deleted whole run
    - had issue and had to redownload
- 2020 + 21 work:
    - files were perfect, easy flow through used 18 sampling info


2024-06-07
- metadata for 15-17
- chose not to try and fix meta but just regex out what I need
- mostly worked but somehow CE_052516 was duplicatd so I just chose one
- realized the metadata management was unnecessary
- also somehow some raw files for non swmp snuck in manually deleted
- all sorts of bad run files within the right folder
    - had to make a hard coded mess in utilites
        - '_', "AA",'1' all 'A'
    - there hidden files in folders
        - ex. CE092915AA is hidden in SC_082715a
            - since everything is processed at raw folder, I manually deleted at raw level
            - deleted A for CE092915
- nearly done but stopped


2024-06-06:
- had to do a bunch still for 15_badnames
- made runfile script generalizable
- meta sample extractor is now a utility for cleanliness
- was able to upload badnames

2024-06-05:
- had to manually correct list files from 0708414 errors
- did in restored version w/ metafix
- messed up because a run file was deleted right now it'll print out error on run_file_reader
2024-06-04:
- finished file moving functions.
- moved file parser to functions
- data are extremely non-uniform
    - important metadata are in the file names
    - need to write data to tsv after morphocut
    - need to handle data in groups based on bad naming convention
- moved 14-15 into a folder
    - had to format and fix things like 0708414 to 070814
- DATA CLEANING NOTES:
    - I deleted any data which had 'test' or 'edited' in it
    - this was a lot of early cases in 2010-2014
    - also some cultures were mixed in
2024-06-03:
- started project
- python for all data processing for easy flow to morphocut
- started basic functions, etc
